information to build the knowledge the sector needs to operate more efficiently and the public needs to give more effectively. Our goal is for people to make better decisions about social change based on good information about nonprofits. To achieve this end, we have developed a system for all nonprofits to add data, stories, and mission-critical information into one central repository and then be able to easily share this information across multiple websites, software systems, and fundraising venues.\",\"question\":{ \"ci_question_id\":1,\"question\":\"What is your organization aiming to accomplish?\" } }, { \"ci_answer_id\":478958,\"organization_id\":7831216,\"answer\":\"GuideStar has three main strategies for realizing this vision over the next five years. (1) Data Collection: GuideStar began 18 years ago by creating a system that helped nonprofits more efficiently share information with the general public. This open platform led to the public display of the IRS Form 990, a financial document hundreds of thousands of nonprofits must file annually with the IRS. Over the years, we encouraged tax-exempt organizations to move beyond this one financial document. As a result, we have begun collecting data about the programs in the sector, the beneficiaries of those programs, and the effectiveness of the organizations achieving social change. We will expand our data collection across multiple dimensions to gather more (a higher number of organizations represented with more information about each), better (a higher quality of information), and faster (delivered and available more quickly) information.  (2) Data Distribution: In addition to our current distribution channels, GuideStar will create new platforms and partnerships to distribute data broadly—to the public, partners, and social investors around the world—so that GuideStar\'s data can form the core of the next generation of social sector tools, services, products, and analysis. (3) Data Innovation: Through the GuideStar Labs (our research and innovation division), we will create new forms of value, such as new products, tools, and initiatives that build on the data we\'ve collected and help make sense of it, while leveraging our distribution channels to reach a wide audience.\",\"question\":{ \"ci_question_id\":2,\"question\":\"What are your strategies for making this happen?\" } }, { \"ci_answer_id\":478959,\"organization_id\":7831216,\"answer\":\"Strengths: Nearly two decades of strong, positive brand recognition and reputation in the sector. Innovative partners that believe in our mission and are willing to help us accomplish that mission. More than 10 million annual visitors to our website who rely on us for information about individual nonprofits. A staff of 60+ professionals skilled in building tools and delivering services to nonprofits, professionals, and individuals. Stable financials and a plan for continued sustainability. An active nonprofit advisory group and users willing to participate in beta trials and surveys. An engaged board of directors from a wide variety of disciplines. A large group of committed funders.   Resources that would help strengthen our work and achieve long-term goals: More funding that can be exclusively devoted to innovation. Access to more nonprofit information.

Thousands of digitized documents outside the Forms 990. (2) Data Distribution: Double our active subscriber base across all subscription products and double the total revenue generated by these products. Create new products to meet the needs of the sector. 10 million unique annual visitors to the websites of the GuideStar DonorEdge Learning Community members. Cultivate more than 250 distribution partners reaching more than 20 million individuals annually. Develop APIs under open, non-commercial licenses with 10,000 annual users.

We have made 2.2 billion pieces of data available, including more than 7.2 million Form 990 image files. We have expanded the sources from which we obtain data. In addition to digitized 990s, we get nonprofit data from: the IRS Business Master File; IRS Publication 78 and the Internal Revenue Bulletin; the Automatic Revocation of Exemption List; the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list of entities engaged in or supporting terrorism; the nonprofits themselves; and data partners such as community foundations and organizations that evaluate nonprofit issues and performance. We now post PDFs of the actual IRS Forms 990, 990-EZ, and 990-PF as well as keying the information from them; currently, we have 7.2 million Form 990 PDFs on the site. We have data directly from more than 90,000 nonprofits participating in the GuideStar Exchange. We have 121 corporate and foundation members. We had more than 6,200 product transactions in 2012. Our customer service team has more than 35,000 conversations each year with GuideStar users, over 30,000 of them being nonprofits. We have over 800,000 subscribers to our opt-in email list. We have more than 50,000 social media followers. More than 3,000 experts have participated in our Philanthropedia research providing recommendations on more than 580 nonprofits across 37 causes. We have more than 30 conversations with the news media each month about nonprofit issues and trends. We have broadened our distribution network by providing nonprofit information to partner sites and through the sales of data for business use. And we have developed several products to help users obtain and use the nonprofit data they need more effectively. With our new strategic plan, there are a number of areas we have not yet accomplished including building on the data we already collect and further strengthening our current programs and products (such as the GuideStar Exchange, DonorEdge, APIs, and our digitization efforts). However there are also completely new initiatives we plan to explore: developing a system to aggregate quantitative programmatic data across nonprofit categories, developing Issue Pages to highlight information about social indicators, interventions, and resources in various cause areas within the philanthropic sector, developing nonprofit sector indices, and developing nonprofit mirror funds. We aim to acquire information about educational institutions and faith-based organizations to enhance our data collection and want to explore expanding our database to include international organizations.

          "program_description": "Operation Heartbeat-Chain of Survival Operation Heartbeat is a national, community-based initiative the American Heart Association has developed to improve the national sudden cardiac arrest survival rate.  Of all people who suffer sudden cardiac arrest outside a hospital, only 5 percent survive.  More than 600 Americans die every day from sudden cardiac arrest, amounting to a staggering annual death toll of 220,000.  Operation Heartbeat focuses on a sequence of four actions that the American Heart Association calls the chain of survival, a proven method for improving sudden cardiac arrest survival.  These actions include 1) Early Access, calling 9-1-1 to access Emergency Medical Services (EMS); 2) Early CPR; 3) Early Defibrillation; and 4) Early Advanced Care.  Operation Heartbeat strengthens the chain of survival by mobilizing local communities and advocating that programs are implemented to strengthen each link of the chain.   Operation Stroke is a community-based program of the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association – is implemented by a coalition of volunteer healthcare professionals (dispatchers, emergency transport drivers, paramedics, fire and police officers, emergency room physicians, nurses, neurologists, neurosurgeons and many others) and civic leaders.    The goal of Operation Stroke is to reduce the number of people who die or become permanently disabled by stroke. The American Stroke Association is doing this by: increasing public awareness of stroke warning signs; increasing the healthcare community’s ability to transport stroke patients; increasing the number of stroke patients who arrive at the hospital in time to receive treatment; and providing access to appropriate acute care for stroke patients across America.  Get With The Guidelines  Get With The GuidelinesSM is a new hospital discharge program that will help reduce the risk of recurrent heart attacks and strokes in patients with coronary and other vascular diseases.  The Get With The GuidelinesSM program works by mobilizing teams in acute-care hospitals to implement the American Heart Association’s secondary prevention guidelines for patients with coronary and other vascular diseases.  The program advocates using quality-improvement measures such as care maps, discharge protocols, standing orders and measurement tools based on the secondary prevention guidelines, which are also endorsed by the American College of Cardiology. The guidelines address these risk factors: smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, alcohol and drug abuse.  MyHeartWatch.org MyHeartWatch.org is a free online behavioral modification program that can help you lose weight, feel better, improve your health and reduce your risk for coronary heart disease and stroke. The MyHeartWatch.org interactive health management program can help, offering features such as Ask An Expert, Recipes, Health Planners including weight and nutrition calculators, exercise diaries and more.  Visit this new free “caring community for preventing heart attack and stroke” at www.myheartwatch.org.  Additional American Heart Association programs that help people reduce their cardiovascular and stroke risk includes: women and heart disease, cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart and stroke risk factors and warning signs, physical fitness, nutrition and CPR training for adults and school children.   Special Events   American Heart Walk The American Heart Walk is the premier fundraising event for the American Heart Association, with a goal to raise $75 million in the next year for cardiovascular disease and stroke research and educational programs. Over 650,000 walkers will participate non-competitively in more than 850 events nationally in the coming months. Walking distances vary, although a majority of the walk routes are between 3K and 5K.  The American Heart Walk is a fun, heart-healthy activity that the whole family can enjoy, while raising critical funds for research and education. The American Heart Walk celebrates survivors and honors the memory of those inflicted by this country’s No.1 and No. 3 killers---heart disease and stroke.  Train To End Stroke American Stroke Association’s Train To End Stroke Marathon Training Program and Fundraiser is for experienced and novice runners and walkers, and everyone in-between.  Participants train for four months with an experienced coach to learn how to run or walk a full or half marathon, while raising funds for stroke education and research.  It’s about reaching personal fitness milestones and becoming a champion for yourself and others who have experienced a stroke.    Jump Rope For Heart Jump Rope For Heart teaches rope-jumping skills that are fun. It promotes the value of physical activity to students while they participate in a team or cooperative effort. The program increases understanding of the seriousness of heart disease and stroke and the lifelong health benefits of physical activity and a heart-healthy lifestyle. While teaching students to set and achieve goals, they discover that they can make a difference. Jump Rope For Heart builds character through the spirit of volunteerism and community service.  Five million elementary school children in 20,000 schools nationwide participated last year in the Jump Rope For Heart program.  Other American Heart Association special event programs include ‘black-tie’ galas held in local communities and Hoops for Heart, a program for junior high students that teaches basketball skills and how to live a heart-healthy life.",

          "answer": "The American Heart Association exists to save and improve lives by preventing and treating heart disease and stroke — the two leading causes of death in the world. Our mission statement is: Building healthier lives, free of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Everything we do serves that mission.  Our mission is critical because almost every American is touched by heart disease or stroke in some way. More than 800,000 people die from these diseases each year, and more than 82.5 million are living with heart disease or the effects of stroke. The direct and indirect costs of these diseases are forecast to top $1 trillion by 2030. The American Heart Association can serve our mission only because of the generosity of our donors. We serve all Americans, with a focus on underserved communities and groups with specific needs.  For example, we develop programs that help African-Americans and Hispanics/Latinos understand their higher risks for heart disease and stroke, and empower them to take action. We are devoted to helping women understand that heart disease is their No. 1 killer, spreading awareness and providing resources to empower them. And we are committed to stopping the childhood obesity crisis that threatens our nation's future.   Using a science-based, strategic approach to serving these audiences and fighting these diseases, we set interim goals to improve the nation's heart health through a carefully constructed Strategic Plan.  We are currently working to improve the cardiovascular health of all Americans by 20 percent by the year 2020, while reducing deaths from cardiovascular diseases and stroke by 20 percent. Reaching our 2020 Impact Goal requires a diverse and far-reaching approach that includes: Funding lifesaving scientific researchPrograms to help people get healthier at home, at school and at workAwareness campaigns to help people understand the risks of heart disease and stroke and actions they can takeCPR, first aid and other training for the public, medical professionals and scientistsHospital quality programs to ensure every patient gets the best care every timeAdvocacy efforts pursuing healthier public policies at the national, state and local levels.

          "answer": "Heart disease and stroke are so far-reaching that a multifaceted strategy is needed to fight them. The American Heart Association's approach is laid out in our Strategic Plan, which can be boiled down to the focus areas.   Science and Research: Science is the backbone of every aspect of our work, because scientific research is the key to stopping, treating and further understanding heart disease and stroke. We use donations to fund more research into heart disease and stroke than any organization except for the U.S. government.  This year we funded 972 new projects. Noted scientists and healthcare professionals volunteer to help us fund the most deserving research and translate the latest science into treatment. We advance knowledge of heart disease and stroke by putting on leading scientific meetings and by publishing 12 revered scientific journals.    Healthy Living: We have created several programs to help people get healthier at home, at work and at play by emphasizing the positive aspects of wellness. We fight childhood obesity in a number of ways, including hands-on Teaching Gardens that teach schoolchildren about nutrition, and by helping enact public policy that makes school foods healthier and ensures PE programs.  We make it easier for people to shop for and prepare healthy and affordable meals. We work with more than 2,400 worksites so employees can get fit at work. Our advocacy efforts on the federal, state and local levels have helped pass clean-air measures and our educational resources help smokers quit.   Treatment and Education: We provide resources and information to heart disease and stroke survivors — and to millions of others so they can avoid these diseases. We believe it is critical to eliminate disparities in health care, which is why we have established programs to help people at higher risk for heart disease and stroke, including African-Americans and Hispanics/Latinos. Our Go Red For Women movement is in its 10th year of helping women understand that heart disease is their No. 1 killer.  Our print and online patient education materials reached millions of Americans last year.   Emergency and Hospital Care: We are the leader in CPR education, training more than 14 million people in over 60 countries this past year. We work in communities across the country to improve systems of care. About 60 percent of the U.S. population is now covered by our Mission: Lifeline program, which ensures the most rapid care for deadly heart attacks that require urgent treatment. Our quality-improvement programs help more than 2,000 hospitals ensure every patient gets the best care every time. More than 200 peer-reviewed manuscripts show these programs lead to vital and lasting healthcare changes.  ",

We are a global leader in the fight against heart disease and stroke, teaming with numerous international organizations to battle these diseases across the world.  Founded in 1924, we bring nearly 90 years of scientific expertise to our mission.   We have a nationwide network of more than 22.5 million volunteers and supporters who work with about 2,700 employees at nearly 150 offices in communities across the country.    The American Heart Association funds more scientific research into cardiovascular diseases and stroke than any organization outside the U.S. government. We have funded 13 Nobel Prize winners and several important medical breakthroughs, including techniques and standards for CPR, the first artificial heart valve, implantable pacemakers, cholesterol inhibitors, microsurgery and drug-coated stents.  In all, we have funded more than $3.4 billion in research since 1949.    More than 30,000 science and medicine professionals serve as volunteers. They advise us on the best research to fund, develop evidence-based treatment guidelines to ensure the best possible care at hospitals nationwide and work closely with our talented staff to ensure science guides all of our programs.   All of the work of the American Heart Association is possible only because of the generosity of donors. We are supported by donations of all sizes, from individual donors, charitable foundations and a variety of corporate partners locally and nationally.   ",

          "answer": "As a science-based organization, accurate measurement is critical to us. We carefully track our long-term and interim progress in the fight heart diseases and stroke, as well as our shorter-term accomplishments.  The donations we receive are also key measurements, because we cannot reach any of our goals without resources.  We use all of our measurements to guide our strategy for research, education, advocacy and other efforts.    Progress toward the 2020 Impact Goal is how we hold ourselves accountable to our mission. Our national volunteer Board of Directors annually monitors progress toward all aspects of this goal, including death rates and the seven key factors that increase the risk for heart disease and stroke: diet, physical activity, body weight, smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar.  Noted scientists and healthcare providers guide us in the tracking of progress toward the 2020 goal. These volunteer experts use federal statistics to track deaths and changes in health factors and behaviors. However, because a major focus of our 2020 goal is improving the health of all Americans, we also are seeking additional measurement tools to more precisely measure progress for African-Americans, Hispanics/Latinos and others at increased risk for heart disease and stroke.   In the shorter term, we track our progress through various measurements. Among them: the amount of scientific research we are able to fund, the volume of public health policies enacted, the number of hospitals enrolled in our quality programs, impact of scientific journals, the number of attendees and research presentations at our professional meetings, the number of people enrolled in our educational and awareness programs, media impressions for our awareness campaigns and science news releases, and website visits.

          "answer": "The American Heart Association contributed greatly to major advances in the fight against heart disease and stroke. Deaths have declined over the past four decades, significant new treatments have been developed, awareness has grown and many new laws are in place to protect the public health.    We also were quite successful in the last 10-year national health goal we set.  That was to reduce heart disease and stroke deaths and risk factors by 25 percent by 2010. We actually surpassed the 2010 goal in terms of deaths — and did so two years early. We also met the goals for lowering uncontrolled high blood pressure and high cholesterol by 25 percent.  We are very early in our measurements of the 2020 goal, but we're already showing that deaths from heart diseases and stroke have dropped 6.1 percent in the past three years for which statistics are available. We've also seen some encouraging improvements in nonsmoking, blood sugar levels and childhood obesity.  Despite these successes, there is much to accomplish.  Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the world. Stroke ranks second and is a leading cause of serious disability. Someone in America has a heart attack every 34 seconds, a stroke every 40 seconds.  Two out of every three adults are overweight or obese, and childhood obesity has tripled over the past three decades.   With more resources, we can do more to combat these growing problems.  For example, we can fund more lifesaving research. Last year we did not have enough money to fund 987 research projects that our science volunteers deemed worthy of support. That \"\"research gap\"\" means nearly 1,000 potential cures, treatments or breakthroughs must wait.   More resources will enable us to reach many more people through our other activities. We could educate more people about living healthier, help more people react in medical emergencies, eliminate health disparities, improve hospital care and work to change laws so our children - and the rest of us - can enjoy healthier environments.",
